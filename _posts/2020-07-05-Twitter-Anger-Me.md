I recently deleted my [Twitter account](https://www.twitter.com/sudoankit) and I think I did right.



I think that should do but here are some more points I thought to mention.

- right now any logical, civil discussion online is nearly impossible without toxicity and hatred
- it's futile to blame anyone as the world is fed up right now and everyone has the right to be in a bad mood, 
- your decisions should be personal not skewed by popular interests. Don't be a sheep.
- if you feel the platform is toxic and it makes you sad -- stay away from it or leave it. **The more you fight against someone online the more sad and angry you'll become.**

I am only on Reddit as of now and if I look back, I left Facebook in 2010, I left Quora in 2016/17 and I left Twitter in June, 2020.

I find my hand often hovering around Reddit's delete options but somehow I still believe that I still can fish out some love out of Reddit's cesspool of politics, of hippies, of crime, of gore and violence. 

Call it *Magic*.
