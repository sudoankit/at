It baffles my mind how complex, compassionate, powerful yet idiotic, silly and hypothetical human imagination can be. 

Few days back I stumbled on a mobile game called ***renal summer***[^1] where you’re in charge of clearing waste deposits in the kidneys of an old, ailing dog. 

The condition is terminal but you still try to lengthen the life of the dog so that it can spend a few more days with the person it loves — an old man who is also badly sick. 

The ending is oxymoronic — the dog dies first and the old grandpa has to bury it with his tears or he dies first gently petting his beloved dog but there’s no one to bury the dog. 

> What will you feel and do?

Aside from the poor gameplay and monetization, I think this is a great story, emotional, powerful yet weird and hypothetical. 

Video games and books are indeed photos of our imagination as recently I have gone through a rain of giant skulls, antibiotics for machines, psychedelics for whores and gliding on Saturn's frozen rings for lust.

Science tabloids, mega corps and venture capitalists who were whispering a decade ago are now constantly shouting about AI and the future ***with it.***

Right now every occurrence of “AI” in general public marketing ads are bluffs. There’s no system, no software that can even make intelligent choices better than even a roundworm eg, *C Elegans*.

The creativity and imagination of a human brain is Nature’s magnus opus. 

Research moves forward trying to create software, language models (GPT-3, OpenAI), high performing vision systems (Waymo, Tesla), planet size recommendation engines and databases (Monarch: Google, FB) and Deep RL models which beat human players in competitive games (DeepMind's AlphaGo & AplhaStar, OpenAI with DOTA2) but at the end all of it, all of that, all of these is math, code and costly hardware running for days. 

Math explains me what is true but I doubt it can explain me why I need to let that dog not die, just yet.
